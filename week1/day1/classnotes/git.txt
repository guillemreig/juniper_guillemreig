GIT

git status - Check what changes you have in your repository.

git add (file_name or . for all) - The add command adds your changes to the staging area. This means they are ready to be committed.

git commit -m "our comment" - Commit the files that you have worked on and that you have added, but the commit is still just on your local computer.

git push -u <remote_name> <local_branch_name> - By pushing, you can send your commits to a remote repository.

git pull <remote_name> <local_branch_name> - This pulls commits from the remote repo that is located at origin.


Branches:

git checkout -b <my_new_branch> - To make a new branch.

git checkout <branch_i_want> - To switch between branches.

git branch - To check your branches, and to see which one you are on.

git branch -D <branch_to_delete> - To delete a local branch. You may also need the -f flag if you have unmerged changes. It may also prompt you to use the -D.

git checkout -b <my_new_branch> origin/master - Will create the new branch and automatically have it set to pull from master.

git remote -v - Check where the remote for your git repo is.

git push origin :<branch_name> - Delete a REMOTE branch.

git clone <remote_repo> - Clone a remote branch to your local computer. This is what you use if you want to copy code from github onto your computer.
